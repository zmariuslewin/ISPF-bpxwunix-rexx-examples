A way to start TK4 from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

On my Windows desk, I have a file u.cmd
It contains only:
wsl ~/m
I double click on it.

My home directory ~ contains a file named m
It contains:
pushd ~/tk4
yes | ./unattended/set_console_mode
./mvs
popd
exit

The Hercules script ~/tk4/scripts/tk4-.rc contains at the end of it:
/stop mf1
sh cmd.exe /c "C:\Program Files (x86)\TomBrennanSoftware\VistaTN3270\vistaTN3270.exe" standard.ses
